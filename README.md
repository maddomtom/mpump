# mpump v1.3.2

Hot-plug MIDI sequencer for USB MIDI devices. Plug in a device and it starts playing immediately. Unplug it and it stops cleanly. No configuration files, no drivers — just USB and sound.

Multiple devices play in sync from a shared clock. Switching patterns or pausing a device waits for the next bar boundary so everything stays phase-locked.

Built for live use: run it before the set, leave it going, connect and disconnect hardware as needed.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install mpump
```

Requires Python 3.11+ and macOS (CoreMIDI). All supported devices are USB class-compliant — no extra drivers needed.

---

## Four interfaces

### Browser sequencer (standalone)

Open `https://your-host/` in Chrome, Edge, or Opera — no install, no server, no Mac required. The sequencer runs entirely in the browser using the Web MIDI API. Connect your MIDI devices via USB, grant MIDI permission, and play.

Firefox works with a Web MIDI add-on. Safari and iOS are not supported (no Web MIDI).

Features: auto-detection of 50 USB MIDI devices, live step-grid visualization, genre/pattern/key/octave switching, tap-to-edit patterns, shuffle button to randomize genre + pattern globally or per-device, save edited patterns to the EXTRAS genre.

To build and serve locally:

```bash
cd mpump/server
python3 scripts/export_patterns.py
npm install && npm run build
npm run preview
```

Deploy `mpump/server/dist/` to any HTTPS host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) for zero-install access from any computer with USB MIDI.

### Web UI (Mac + Python)

```bash
mpump-web
```

Opens a web server on port 8080. Point any browser on the local network at `http://<your-mac-ip>:8080` — works great from iOS Safari. Supports Add-to-Home-Screen for a full-screen PWA experience.

Features: live step-grid visualization, genre/pattern/key/octave switching, tap-to-edit patterns, save edited patterns to the EXTRAS genre. Multiple browser clients can connect simultaneously.

### Terminal UI

```bash
mpump-ui
```

Three-panel TUI showing S-1, T-8 and J-6 side by side. Browse and commit patterns live.

### Headless CLI

```bash
mpump --cli
```

Starts immediately with the given flags, no UI.

## Supported devices

The browser sequencer auto-detects 50 USB MIDI devices. Devices are recognized by their USB MIDI port name and start playing automatically when plugged in.

**Tested** = verified with hardware. **Untested** = port names may need adjustment; please report issues.

All 50 devices are supported across all interfaces (browser sequencer, CLI, TUI, web UI). The TUI shows dedicated panels for S-1, T-8, and J-6; other devices are auto-detected and sequenced in CLI and web modes.

## Web UI (`mpump-web`)

```bash
mpump-web                     # defaults: BPM 120, port 8080
mpump-web --bpm 133           # custom tempo
mpump-web --port 9000         # custom port
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--bpm N` | `120` | Initial tempo (20-300) |
| `--port N` | `8080` | HTTP port to listen on |

### Pattern editing

Tap any step in the grid to toggle it on/off. Long-press (or right-click) a step to open the detail editor where you can adjust semitone offset, velocity, and slide. Edited patterns can be saved to the **EXTRAS** genre, which persists across sessions in `~/.mpump/extras.json` and is available in all three interfaces.

---

## Terminal UI (`mpump-ui`)

```bash
mpump-ui                                        # defaults
mpump-ui --bpm 133 --genre acid-techno --pattern 3
mpump-ui --t8-genre dub-techno --t8-pattern 5 --t8-bass-pattern 2
mpump-ui --j6-genre trance --j6-pattern 4
```

### Key bindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Cycle focus: S-1 -> T-8 -> J-6 |
| `<- / ->` | Previous / next genre |
| `up / down` | Previous / next pattern (browse only) |
| `Enter` | Commit browsed pattern/genre to device |
| `b / B` | T-8 bass pattern down / up (browse only) |
| `k / K` | Root key down / up (immediate, S-1 and T-8) |
| `o / O` | Octave down / up (immediate, S-1 and T-8) |
| `Space` | Pause / resume focused device |
| `= / -` | BPM +5 / -5 |
| `q` | Quit |

Browse with arrow keys (and `b/B` for bass) then press `Enter` to apply. The now-playing strip always shows what is actually running.

## Pattern library

### S-1 — 150 patterns, 15 genres x 10

Genres: `techno`, `acid-techno`, `trance`, `dub-techno`, `idm`, `edm`, `drum-and-bass`, `house`, `breakbeat`, `jungle`, `garage`, `ambient`, `glitch`, `electro`, `downtempo`

All patterns are expressed as semitone offsets from the root, so `--key` and `--octave` transpose them freely. All synth-mode devices in the browser sequencer share these patterns.

```bash
mpump --list           # full catalogue with descriptions
```

### T-8 — 150 drum + 150 bass patterns, 15 genres x 10 each

Drum and bass patterns are selected independently. All drums-mode and drums+bass-mode devices in the browser sequencer share these patterns.

```bash
mpump --list-t8        # drum patterns
mpump --list-t8-bass   # bass patterns
```

### J-6 — 150 chord progressions, 15 genres x 10

Root is always C (MIDI 60). On connect, mpump sends a Program Change to auto-select the matching chord set on the J-6.

```bash
mpump --list-j6
```

### EXTRAS — user-created patterns

Patterns edited and saved via the web UI or TUI are stored in `~/.mpump/extras.json` and appear as the **extras** genre in all interfaces. In the browser sequencer, extras are stored in localStorage and are independent of the file-based extras.

---

## Sync model

All devices share a single step-grid anchored to a global `t0`. Every sequencer starts at the next **bar boundary** (16 steps from `t0`), so:

- Devices that connect at different times are always phase-locked within one bar
- Pattern changes and pause/resume introduce at most one bar of delay, then re-enter on the beat
- BPM changes reset `t0` and batch-restart all devices at the same boundary

MIDI clock (24 PPQN) is sent to devices that support it for BPM-synced effects (LFO, delay, arpeggiator). No MIDI Start/Stop messages are sent, so the devices' internal sequencers are not triggered.

---

## How slides work

On acid patterns, steps marked `slide=True` send the next `note_on` before the previous `note_off`. On a monosynth like the S-1 or TD-3, this triggers legato / portamento if portamento is enabled on the device.

## Tested on

- macOS Sequoia 15, Python 3.11
- Roland S-1, T-8, J-6 (hot-plug + playback confirmed)
- Roland SP-404MK2 (hot-plug confirmed; pattern playback not yet hardware-tested)
- Browser sequencer: all 50 devices in registry (port names for non-Roland devices need hardware verification)
